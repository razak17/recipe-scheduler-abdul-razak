BACKEND
Strengths:
- Solid grasp of microservices,
 queues, containerization, and TypeScript
- Clear and comprehensive documentation
-
Areas Needing Improvement:
- Testing: No unit/integration tests or CI pipeline
- Production Readiness: Lacks pagination,
 rate limiting, health checks, and robust error handling
- Observability: Minimal logging, no monitoring or tracing
- Security: No solid error handling and validation.
- Performance: No caching, DB optimization,
 or scalability strategies
Recommendations: Introduce testing,
CI/CD, logging, monitoring, authentication,
 pagination, caching, and performance tuning
 to elevate the app to production standards.
